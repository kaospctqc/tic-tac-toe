We are using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create a fun to play game.

## UX

## 1.1 Wireframe

Before implementing any html, css or javascript, we used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes that describe the initial design of the application. This step help a lot when implementing the html, css and javascript.

## 1.2 Color Scheme

The color scheme influences the users state and the design choice was to try to achieve something calming, relaxing.
When searching for the color scheme, we used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ebede9-d2d4c8-b8bdb5-889696-5f7470) as a starting point.

The next tool used was [webaim.org](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) that helped achieve a good level of contrast while maintaining the overall scheme that we wanted to use.
